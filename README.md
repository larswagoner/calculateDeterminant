# calculateDeterminant
Calculates the determinant of a matrix.

The program opens a .txt file containing one or multiple matrices, something like:

1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9
=
10 111 13 14
20 21 122 23
30 31 32 133
140 41 42 43

Each column separated by a space, each row by a new line, and each matrix by an equals sign.
